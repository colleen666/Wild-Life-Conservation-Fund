                <h1>Project: Koala</h1> 
                <p>Koalas are one of Australiaâ€™s most iconic and admired native animals. Sadly they are now also threatened with extinction. This project supports the koala research team at Western Sydney University working with koalas based within the Blue Mountains region. The project involves fitting koalas with radio collars. This important piece of equipment allows a team of researchers to track how far these koalas move, how often they encounter other koalas and, of particular interest, what these koalas eat. Researchers learn what koalas have eaten through a chemical analysis of their poo and leaves in a laboratory. We support this project through fundraising, education and advocacy which enables researchers to continue and expand their koala research and monitoring program.</p>

                <p>Once very common, the Tasmanian Devil population has been in steep decline over the last two decades based largely on the spread of a contagious cancer known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD). This project supports the Tasmanian Devil research team at the University of Sydney working on unlocking the secrets of DFTD and providing vital genetic information into the captive breeding program. We support this project through fundraising, education and advocacy which enables researchers to continue and expand their research into DFTD and the recovery </p>

                <p>Wombats like many native animals are often subject to road collisions. This project supports Sleepy Burrows Wombat Sanctuary which is a rescue centre located just outside Canberra that specialises in rehabilitating injured and or orphaned wombats. We support this project through fundraising, education, advocacy and volunteer support which will enable the sanctuary to continue to care for orphaned and or injured wombats and construct new enclosures.</p>

                <h1>Project: School Reach-out</h1> 
                <p>WILD LIFE Conservation Fund aims to visits schools within the Sydney region to inspire pro wildlife action amongst our youngest generation. We take along some of our favourite animal ambassadors with the help of WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo staff and run interactive animal presentations. With the help of these iconic Australian animals we teach the students about the interconnectedness between humans and nature and the importance of conserving native wildlife. We also donate a small amount of native plants to the school that with the help of the students are planted on their grounds as a native bush garden that will encourage local wildlife to visit and provide food and shelter for many local species for years to come serving as a reminder of the role we can play to conserve native wildlife.  </p>
