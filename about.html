                <p>We take responsibility for the animals in our care and understand the role we must play in the
                    conservation of endangered creatures and habitats around the world. We work to world-class welfare
                    standards through our animal care network, and we support the WILD LIFE Conservation Fund in its
                    missions to protect unique Australian animals and their habitats. </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>At WLCF we believe in conservation through education. Working with WLCF we have the unique
                    opportunity to impart conservation messages upon thousands each year. We can bring our guests face
                    to face with live animals that can be seen, heard, smelt and, occasionally, touched. This can
                    inspire interest and wonder and can create experiences that make people want to take action to
                    conserve native wildlife.</p>

                <p>Our vision is a world where vital habitats and wildlife are respected and conserved. Our mission at
                    the WLCF is to generate interest, inspire awareness, share knowledge and take action to conserve
                    native wildlife. We aim to achieve this through fundraising, hosting educational talks and local
                    initiatives such as our school outreach programs. We can only achieve this with your support.</p>

                <h2>Fundraising</h2>
                <p>The animals that call WILD LIFE Sydney home act as fundraising ambassadors for their wild
                    counterparts. Funds raised through WLCF go directly towards research, education and conservation
                    projects, which aim to ensure a sustainable future for Australian landscapes and the animals within
                    them.</p>
